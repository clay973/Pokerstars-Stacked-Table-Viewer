Online Poker Stacked Table Previewer (From 2010)

AutoHotKey (AHK) script which shows thumbnail previews of all open Pokerstars, Full Tilt and iPoker tables. Like those that show when you hover over the task bar except all tables are shown rather than just the one hovered over.

Requires Vista/Windows7 with aero turned on.script for previewing stacked tables using the Windows 7 preview.
